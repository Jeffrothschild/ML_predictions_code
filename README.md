# ML_predictions_code

This code accompanies the paper "Predicting daily recovery during long-term endurance training using Machine Learning analysis".

Data from the study is still being used and analyzed for other purposes, so a synthetic version of the dataset was created using the {synthpop} pacakge for purposes of running the code.

A series of models were constructed for the paper. Sample code is provided for a single outcome variable (AM PRS score - labeled as AM_zq_score), but the same code was used for the other outcome variables.
