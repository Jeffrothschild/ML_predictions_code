# ML_predictions_code

This code accompanies the paper "Predicting daily recovery during long-term endurance training using Machine Learning analysis".

Data from the study is still being used and analyzed for other purposes, so **a synthetic version of the dataset was created using the {synthpop} pacakge for purposes of running the code.**

A series of models were constructed for the paper. Sample code is provided for a single outcome variable (AM PRS score - labeled as AM_zq_score), but the same code was used for the other outcome variables.

An example of participant data is also included, with the steps used to combine the diet, training, and subjective measures into a single data file.
